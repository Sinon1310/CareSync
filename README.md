### üí° Problem & Solution

| Feature | Problem Addressed | CareSync Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Continuity** | Doctors can only monitor vitals during sporadic office visits. | **Daily Patient Logging:** Patients securely log key vitals (BP, Blood Sugar, Heart Rate) from home. |
| **Proactivity** | Critical fluctuations in vitals often go unnoticed, leading to complications. | **Real-Time Alerts:** System automatically notifies doctors of abnormal or critical readings for immediate intervention. |
| **Clarity** | Raw data is overwhelming and difficult to interpret over time. | **Trend Visualization:** Data is presented in intuitive charts and graphs on the Doctor Dashboard, making long-term health trends clear. |
